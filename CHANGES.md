# Release Notes

## v0.5.1 - September 29, 2021

* **FEATURE:** recipes now have a `qc` and `products` attribute. These are pandas data frames used to collect QCs and generated products throughout the life-time of the recipe. They are printed to STDOUT at the end of the recipe (can be used in the future to send post request to health monitor API with JSON content in request body).
* **ENHANCEMENT** added code-base to conda-forge
* **ENHANCEMENT** added bottleneck to the install requirement (makes image combination more efficient)
* **ENHANCEMENT** masked pixel now coloured red in quicklook plots (easier to differentiate from good pixels)
* **ENHANCEMENT** low-sensitivity pixels in lamp-flats now identified and added to bad-pixel mask
* **ENHANCEMENT** add a verbosity flag to the command-line and a verbose parameter to each recipe
* **REFACTOR** inter-order pixel value in flats now set to unity (instead of running background fitting and subtraction)
* **REFACTOR:** recipes now have their recipe name as a `recipeName` attribute


## v0.5.0 - June 10, 2021

* **FEATURE** Added a new `filenamer` module that implements a strict intermediate and reduced file-naming scheme
* **FEATURE:** `soxs_mflat` recipe now included
* **FEATURE:** `soxs_spatial_solution` recipe is now included
* **FEATURE:** `subtract_background` utility added
* **FEATURE:** added a `detect_order_edges` object
* **FEATURE:** Added a `dispersion_map_to_pixel_arrays` function to convert from order-based and wavelength arrays to pixel arrays (first guess dispersion map only so far)
* **FEATURE:** added a quicklook function in toolkit to quickly visualise a frame
* **FEATURE:** added a toolkit module for small functions used throughout soxspipe 
* **FEATURE:** added function in toolkit to unpack an order table into lists of coordinates, one list per order.
* **FEATURE:** added image slice tool to toolkit
* **ENHANCEMENT** Added a `-o <outputDirectory>` switch to the command-line to optionally override the 'intermediate-data-root' setting in the settings file.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added a fraction of a second tolerance when matching exptimes between darks and science/calibration frames 
* **ENHANCEMENT:** y limits now added to the order table to show limits of order locations on detector
* **REFACTOR:** Change the "SOXSPIPE PRE" date stamp keyword to "SXSPRE" to future-proof for phase III (8 character keyword limit)
* **REFACTOR:** Pandas tables are now used through-out code to pass line-lists between methods
* **REFACTOR:** refactoring of polynomial fitting has made creation of dispersion maps ~50 times faster
* **REFACTOR:** removed OBID from file names and added readout mode. This information is more helpful at the glance.
* **FIXED:** correct binning reported in product file names
* **FIXED:** lines in a sof file beginning with a `#` are considered as comments and therefore ignored by the pipeline.

## v0.4.1 - September 15, 2020

* **FEATURE:** add command-line util for soxs order_centres recipe
* **FEATURE** added the `detect_continuum` utility to fit order centre locations in single pinhole flat frames.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added a supplementary file list for non-fits input files in set-of-file util
* **ENHANCEMENT:** adding more information residual plots & visualisation of fitting for disp solution
* **ENHANCEMENT:** check that files in the sof files exist before proceeding.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added spectral format table lookup to detector settings file
* **REFACTOR:** moved chebyshev order/wavelength polynomials into its own class - decoupled from create_dispersion_map class

## v0.4.0 - September 3, 2020

* **FEATURE:** added create_dispersion_map class to be used in `soxs_disp_solution` and `soxs_spatial_solution`
* **FEATURE:** added a `subtract_calibrations` method to subtract calibration frames (bias and dark) from an input frame
* **FEATURE:** added the dispersion solution recipe and unit tests
* **FEATURE:** added the disp_solution command-line tool
* **DOCS:** major docs overhaul
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added predicted lines lists to detector parameter file
* **ENHANCEMENT:** DPR CATG and DPR TECH added to metadata of sof imagefilecollection objects
* **ENHANCEMENT:** wcs copied from a single frame into the combined frames during clip and stack
* **REFACTOR:** bad-pixel map paths abstracted to detector settings files
* **REFACTOR:** renaming of unit-testing test data directories
* **REFACTOR:** only filenames reported by sof summaries when files are found in the same directory (easier to read on terminal) 
* **FIXED:** fixed detector science pixels for UVB

## v0.3.1 - August 25, 2020

* **FEATURE:** recipe & command-line tool for master dark creation (`mdark`)
* **ENHANCEMENT:** default binning add to detector settings file
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added mixed exposure time unit test for dark-frames
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added default values for gain and ron in the detector settings files. Default values can be overwritten if correct GAIN and RON are found in fits-headers (overwritten for UVB and VIS but not NIR for XShooter)
* **ENHANCEMENT:** can now interrupt "~" as home directory in sof file path
* **FIXED:** binning factor used when trimming frames
* **FIXED:** the trimming dimensions of NIR frames - bad-pixel map now aligns correctly with data frame
* **FIXED:** science pixels for all 3 xshooter detectors in parameters file

## v0.3.0 - August 18, 2020

* **FEATURE:** added a `write` method to the `_base_recipe` to write frames to disk (renames extensions to ESO preferred naming scheme)
* **FEATURE:** detector lookup class added alongside yaml files to host detector specific parameters (rotation, science-pixels etc). Code has been updated to remove hard-wired detector values.
* **FEATURE:** added a cleanup method to remove intermediate file once recipe completes
* **ENHANCEMENT:** parameters for clip and stack method added to the settings files
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added strict typing of data and variables with astropy units to avoid silent mistakes in frame arithmetic 
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added mixing of readout speeds to input frame verification checks
* **ENHANCEMENT:** added readnoise and gain to the list of keyword values to check during frame verification
* **ENHANCEMENT:** inject a 'SOXSPIPE PRE' keyword with timestamp value into prepared frames
* **ENHANCEMENT:** check frames for 'SOXSPIPE PRE' keyword before preparing - raises exception if found
* **ENHANCEMENT:** ron and gain are added to the recipe's detector lookup dictionary during frame verification (so they don't need read again later)
* **REFACTOR:** moved stacking code to it own `clip_and_stack` method hosted in the `_base_recipe`
* **REFACTOR:** moved basic input frame verifications to the `_base_recipe` - so not to repeat code
* **REFACTOR:** removed python 2.7 support - not feasible with CCDProc
* **DOCS:** added workflow diagrams to the documentation for many of the methods implemented (`prepare_frames()`, ``clip_and_stack``)

## v0.2.0 - February 27, 2020

* **FEATURE** added keyword lookups - abstracting exact keyword names from code
