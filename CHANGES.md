## v0.8.0 - March 3, 2023

* **ENHANCEMENT:** move information printed to STDOUT when preparing a workspace to inform the user of how the data is organised
* **ENHANCEMENT:** code can automatically adjust polynomial fitting parameters to find a dispersion solution if those provided in the settings file fail.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** uncompression of fits.Z files (if any) occurs before data-organising
* **REFACTOR:** speed & robustness improvements to dispersion solution to 2D image map conversion.
