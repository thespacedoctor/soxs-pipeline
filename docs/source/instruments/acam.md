## Acquisition Camera

Although the SOXS acquisition and guiding camera will mainly be used for the acquisition of sources to allow for the centring of targets on the slits, it will also provide science-grade imaging capability. The Andor iKon M934 camera detector has a $1024\times1024$ pixel BEX2-DD CCD providing a $3.5\times3.5$ arcmin FOV with a 0.205 arcsec pixel scale. 7 filters are provided; the 6 LSST $u, g, r, i, z, y$ and the $V$ Johnston filter. See {cite:t}`brucalassi2018a` for more detail.
