The fixed format of the SOXS UV-VIS and NIR spectrometers means the only changeable part of the instrument is the slit width. Reducing science frames requires flat-field and flux-calibration frames exposed with an identical slit-width. Slit width may also affect the telluric absorption correction since the instrumental resolution may change. The bulk of the SOXS usage will be with a one arcsec slit, with options for a wider slit for accurate throughput measurements and absolute flux calibration in some instances and in times of poor seeing.
