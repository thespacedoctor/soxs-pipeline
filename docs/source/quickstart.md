# Quickstart

## Initialising soxspipe

Before you begin using soxspipe you need to use the `init` command to generate a user settings file. Running the following:

```bash
rockfinder init
```

creates a yaml settings file in your home foler under `~/.config/soxspipe/soxspipe.yaml`. This is where most of the soxspipe setting can be adjusted to liking.

<!-- Once created, open the settings file in any text editor and follow the in-file instructions to populate the missing settings values (usually given an ``XXX`` placeholder).  -->
