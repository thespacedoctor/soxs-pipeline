The ` soxs_spatial_solution` recipe enhances the wavelength solution achieved with [`soxs_disp_solution`](../recipes/soxs_disp_solution.md) by expanding the solution into the spatial dimension (along the slit). The resulting 2-dimensional solution accounts for any tilt in the spectral lines relative to the cross-dispersion axis. The recipe is similar in logic to [`soxs_disp_solution`](../recipes/soxs_disp_solution.md), but now samples arc lines along the slit in the cross-dispersion direction using a multi-pinhole slit mask.
