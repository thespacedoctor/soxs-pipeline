# `soxs_order_centres` - COMPLETED

The purpose of the [`soxs_order_centres`](../_api/soxspipe.recipes.soxs_order_centres.html) recipe is to find and fit the order centres with low-level polynomials.

It takes are input a single-pinhole flat-lamp frame and the [dispersion map](../files/dispersion_map.md) generated by the [`soxs_disp_solution` recipe](../recipes/soxs_disp_solution.md). 

Once the single-pinhole flat-lamp frame has had the bias, dark and background subtracted it is passed to the [detect_continuum utility](../utils/detect_continuum.md) to fit the order centres.

The product of this recipe is an [order table](../files/order_table.md) containing coefficients to the polynomial fits describing the order centre locations.

Plots similar to the one below are generated after each execution of [`soxs_order_centres`](../_api/soxspipe.recipes.soxs_order_centres.html).
