# `reduce`

In the simplest use case, you will want to reduce all of the raw frames contained within your workspace. To do this, first change directory to the base of your workspace, and then run the commands:

```bash
soxspipe prep .
soxspipe reduce all . 
``` 

`soxspipe` will now attempt to reduce all of the data in your workspace.
