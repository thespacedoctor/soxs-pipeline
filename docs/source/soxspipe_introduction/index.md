# An Introduction to soxspipe

`soxspipe` is an open-source Python package that can be installed via pip or conda (via the community-maintained conda-forge channel). The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/thespacedoctor/soxspipe), where users can report feature requests or bugs via GitHub issues. More adventurous Python-literate users are encouraged to fork the code, add features or fix bugs, and then issue a pull request for the `soxspipe` development team to consider.
