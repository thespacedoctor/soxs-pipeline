## Purpose

The purpose of the SOXS Data Reduction pipeline (`soxspipe`) is to remove all instrument signatures from SOXS scientific data frames using the appropriate calibration data. `soxspipe` supports reducing data taken in each available observation mode, converting this data into physical units, and delivering them with their associated error bars to the [ESO SAF](http://archive.eso.org/cms.html). The pipeline also generates QC metrics to monitor telescope, instrument, and detector health. Errors are propagated through each data reduction stage and delivered within the final data products.

Running at the summit in La Silla, `soxspipe` delivers science-ready, fully reduced data products immediately after an exposure completes. The target users of `soxspipe` are the ESO Data Products and Quality Control Group (DPQC), the La Silla Science Operators (to be used as a quick look tool), the SOXS consortium and the general user community that may want to perform tailored processing of SOXS data.
