# Reducing Data


`soxspipe` has an extensive set of usage commands. Running `soxspipe -h` will give the complete list of these commands.

Like ESO pipelines, `soxspipe` is designed to execute `recipes`, which accept set-of-files (SOF) files as inputs and output specific data products. Each recipe reduces data from a particular stage of the data-reduction cascade (e.g., bias or flat frames). As each subsequent recipe in the data-reduction cascade relies on products generated by previous recipes, the recipes need to be run in order. Of course, the user is free to [run the pipeline recipe-by-recipe](recipe_reductions.md), but most users will opt to use the `soxspipe reduce`, which allows for the reduction of all data in the correct order, with one command.
