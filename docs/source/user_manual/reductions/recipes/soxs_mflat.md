A QC plot resulting from the `soxs_mflat` recipe (Xshooter NIR). The top panel shows the upper and lower-order edge detections registered in the individual cross-dispersion slices in an Xshooter NIR flat frame. The bottom panel shows the global polynomial fits to the upper and lower-order edges, with the area between the fits filled with different colours to reveal the unique echelle orders across the detector plane.
