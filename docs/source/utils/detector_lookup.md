# `detector_lookup`

The purpose of the [`detector_lookup`](#soxspipe.commonutils.detector_lookup) utility is to act as reference in the code for the various characteristics of the soxs detectors. 

When initiated [`detector_lookup`](#soxspipe.commonutils.detector_lookup) reads the detector characteristics from a [Detector Parameters](../files/detector_parameters.md) file and can later serve these parameters to the soxspipe code when requested.
